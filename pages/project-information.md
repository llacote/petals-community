# History

Petals ESB started as a French research project named JOnES (Java OpeN source ESb), with EBM Websourcing as its leader, in 2004. The official first release intervened on 2007. Since then, Petals ESB became the core of a feature-rich platform, with numerous components to connect external sources or transform messages, an integrated development environment (IDE) to accelerate integration and many other tools to administrate or monitor the platform.
