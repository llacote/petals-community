# Current projects
As Petals suite is divided in many subprojects, history separated them on several tools. 
In the next months, we plan a full reorganization of our source code infrastructure around one central platform: GitHub. For now, use the following to check out our code.

+ SVN (public): [https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/](https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/trunk/product/dev/prod/"Petals ESB 4.x and components source repository") - for Petals ESB and components.

+ Miroir Git Hub: [https://github.com/petalslink/](https://github.com/petalslink/"Petals Studio source repository") - For Petals Studio

# Archives
These are the repositories to look for if you want to get source code for older releases of Petals products.

+ Petals ESB prior to 3.0, and related components and tools: [https://forge.ebmwebsourcing.com](https://forge.ebmwebsourcing.com"EBM Websourcing's local forge for Petals ESB") and [http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petals/](http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petals/"OW2's repository for Petals ESB") (some components/tools releases are on one or the another).

# Experimental
Here are listed repositories for discontinued or alpha projects.

+ Petals Master: [http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petalsmaster/](http://forge.ow2.org/projects/petalsmaster/"Petals Master repository on OW2 forge") - Host for our in-development tool of 
SOA governance (prototype).
